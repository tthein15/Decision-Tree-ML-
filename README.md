# Decision-Tree-ML-
This data set has six binary features:  First class (whether the passenger was in first class or not) Sex (0 = Male, 1 = Female) Age(0=&lt;25,1=25+) SibSp (had siblings/spouses aboard?) ParCh (had parents/children aboard?)  Embarked (Left from Southhampton?) Based on these features, the Titanic task is to learn to predict the last column, whether or not the passenger survived.
